<h2>The Miser</h2>
<h3>SCENE I.--VALÈRE, ÉLISE.</h3>
<h6 class ="ELI."></h6> <p class="speech">No, Valère, I do not regret what I do for you; I feel carried on<br>
by too delightful a power, and I do not even wish that things should<br>
be otherwise than they are. Yet, to tell you the truth, I am very<br>
anxious about the consequences; and I greatly fear that I love you<br>
more than I should.</p>

<h6 class ="VAL."></h6> <p class ="speech">What can you possibly fear from the affection you have shown me?</p>

<h6 class ="ELI."></h6> <p class ="speech">Everything; the anger of my father, the reproaches of my family,<br>
the censure of the world, and, above all, Valère, a change in your<br>
heart! I fear that cruel coldness with which your sex so often repays<br>
the too warm proofs of an innocent love.</p>

<h6 class ="VAL."></h6> <p class ="speech">Alas! do not wrong me thus; do not judge of me by others. Think<br>
me capable of everything, Élise, except of falling short of what I owe<br>
to you. I love you too much for that; and my love will be as lasting<br>
as my life!</p>

<h6 class ="ELI."></h6> <p class ="speech">Ah! Valère, all men say the same thing; all men are alike in<br>
their words; their actions only show the difference that exists<br>
between them.</p>

<h6 class ="VAL."></h6> <p class ="speech"> Then why not wait for actions, if by them alone you can judge of<br>
the truthfulness of my heart? Do not suffer your anxious fears to<br>
mislead you, and to wrong me. Do not let an unjust suspicion destroy<br>
the happiness which is to me dearer than life; but give me time to<br>
show you by a thousand proofs the sincerity of my affection.</p>

<h6 class ="ELI."></h6> <p class="speech">Alas! how easily do we allow ourselves to be persuaded by those<br>
we love. I believe you, Valère; I feel sure that your heart is utterly<br>
incapable of deceiving me, that your love is sincere, and that you<br>
will ever remain faithful to me. I will no longer doubt that happiness<br>
is near. If I grieve, it will only be over the difficulties of our<br>
position, and the possible censures of the world.</p>

<h6 class ="VAL."></h6> <p class="speech">But why even this fear?</p>
